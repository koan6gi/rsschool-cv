#### Briefly About Myself

    I'm 18 years old student from Belarus, study at the BSUIR, attend this course,
    because want to get new knowledge and skills in the web technologies sphere.


#### Skills

> - C++
>
> - Delphi
>
> - Flat Assembly

#### Code Example

> Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of
> that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
> 
> Example: The binary representation of `1234` is `10011010010`, so the function should return `5` in this case
>
> ``` C++
>   unsigned int countBits(unsigned long long n){
>       unsigned long long count1 = 0;
>           for(unsigned long long i = 1; i<=n; i = i*2){
>               if((i & n) == i) count1++;
>           }
>       return count1;
>   }
> ```
